Aswat's code:

Question 1:
  1. He used "date +'%m/%d/%Y'" to get current date.
  2. He used "date +%r" to get current time.
  3. He used $USER to get username.
  4. He used $HOME to get path of Home directory.
  5. He used pwd to get path of current directory.
  
Question 2:
  1. He first stores the first argument in a variable named var.
  2. Then he checked whether it is empty or not.
  3. If it was not empty then he ran a loop and printed the table.
  
 Question 3:
  1. He first took a user input to get the number.
  2. He then made a function to check prime number.
  3. If the number was less than 0 then he simply printed that number is not a prime number.
  4. Then he ran a loop till square root of the number and counted number of factors.
  5. After leaving the loop he checked if the number of factors is equal to 2 then it is a prime number else it is  not.
  
Question 4:
  1. He made a directory using mkdir command.
  2. Then he created a file inside it using touch command.
  3. Then he appended the contents of table.sh into this file using >>.
  4. He then appended "Welcome to Sigmoid" using >>.
  5. He printed the contents of Desktop simply by doing ls ~/Desktop.
  
 Question 5:
  1. He printed the length of the array using ${#arr[*]}.
  2. Then he took max as -1 and min as 1000.
  3. Then he iterated over the entire array and updated max and min.
  4. After leaving the loop he printed the max and min values.
  
  
Rohit's code:

Question 1:
  1. He has used date function for date and time with +'%y-%m-%d' for date and +'%r' for time.
  2. He has used whoami for current user.
  3. He has used environment variable HOME for getting path of home directory and pwd command to get path of current directory.

Question 2.
  1. He took input from the command line.
  2. He then checked whether the argument list is empty or not.
  3. Then he stored the length of argument list in a variable.
  4. Then a iterated over the argument list and printed the table of numbers stored in the argument list.
  
Question 3.
  1. He took input form the user.
  2. He created a function to check prime number.
  3. If number was negative then he returned.
  4. If number was equal to 1 then he printed not a prime number.
  5. Then he ran a loop till square root of the number and counted number of factors.
  6. After leaving the loop he checked if the number of factors is equal to 2 then it is a prime number else it is  not.
  
Question 4.
